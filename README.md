#Chess Reader

OpenCB is an interactive reader of chess books. Play through the lines in the book, or try your own, it's like having a chess board and a chess book in the palm of your hand. The project is currently being used by various publishers on the market.

##Files

This distribution consists of the full source code for the book reader, including a Xcode project that can be compiled. A few sample books are included.

Due to copyright laws, full books are not included. Only the reader is included with this distribution. Contributions for books or source code is welcome. The software is not very useful without the books, however, interested developers could study the source code to learn how an ebook app works (JavaScript + UIWebView).
